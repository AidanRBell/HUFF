"HUFF" is a 2D Platforming Game being developed independently using the Unity Engine.

The player controls Huff, a young sentient cloud dealing with the troubles of his day-to-day life. He soon discovers this game's core mechanic, Voltage (electricity), which the player gains and spends on specialized jumps. As the game progresses, the player learns more jumps, and the game quickly demands upon the player to craft and execute the appropriate combination of them.
